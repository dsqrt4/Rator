# Rator
A contribution to the 2021 MongoDB Hackathon hosted by [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com/).

## What is this?
A very crude, barely minimum vp Todo App.

## Why is this app called Rator if its a half baked todo app?
It was supposed to be an app where I could rate things I tried, like instant ramen and beverages, because I tend to forget which things I liked and which not, and why that was the case for any item.

# Why did it not become the Rator it should have been?
Maybe it was a little ambitious to try so many new things at once (App Platform, Mongo and the entire .NET thing).
Also I was caught in a really bad crunch at work and I was sick during the last weekend I could have dedicated to the project.

## Is this good?
No, absolutely. Don`t use or even look at it.
But while it is kind of a disgrace, developing this app has actually taught me a lot and I will definitely revisit this topic as well as the dotnet platform and Blazor.

Thanks to DigitalOcean for hosting this Hackathon hnd providing the credits to try out app platform and your managed mongo db services.
If I would have had more time I would have tried and done more things. I'll try to progress this soon and follow  up with some proper docs and blog posts if I can.
